# SQL Problems

Solutions to SQL problems.

I've only bothered solving the hardest (free) problems, and I'll add some notes on what I thought of the platform below.

> [!WARNING]
>
> This repository will contain spoilers for the problems. If you want to solve them yourself, do not look at the solutions.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Some notes on terms/phrases I use here:
>
> - "_Recommended solution_" means a solution provided by the platform itself.
> - "_Community solution_" means a solution provided by the community.

## DataLemur

> [!NOTE]
>
> The problems are available at:
>
> - https://datalemur.com/
>
> The platform uses PostgreSQL only (version 14.11 at the time of writing).
>
> There are only 8 free hard problems.

### Pros ‚úîÔ∏è

The problems do get you to think and use some not-so-common logic, which is good!

The problem statements have sample data and expected results, which is great for testing your solutions -- feels a lot like LeetCode/TDD üòâ

The platform is easy to use, has a fast response time, and the discussion tab has some good alternative community solutions.

The solutions tab sometimes provides alternative approaches too -- one even showed off a recursive CTE!

### Cons ‚ùå

Some of the recommended solutions could be better:

- There are some database features that the solutions could use to make the queries more concise and readable.
- The recommended solution for the [updated-status](src/data-lemur/updated-status.sql) problem wraps all the business logic into a case statement. This is bad practice given that the solution could have used a lookup table<sup>\*</sup>, which is what SQL is all about!
- I frankly disagree with the approach for one solution ([median-search-freq](src/data-lemur/median-search-freq.sql)).

<sup>\*</sup>The DataLemur platform wasn't accepting several variant of the `VALUES` clause even though it was valid SQL. This feels like a bug in the platform.

I'm not sure about the premium hard questions, but based on the free ones, the problems are only moderately difficult -- I have to solve harder problems on a daily basis as an analytics engineer, so I don't think these are great preparation for a senior technical role.

## Analyst Builder

> [!NOTE]
>
> The problems are available at:
>
> - https://www.analystbuilder.com/
>
> The platform uses a mix of databases and languages.
>
> There are only 3 free hard problems, and 0 free very hard problems.

### Pros ‚úîÔ∏è

The platform looks and feels really nice!

Similar to DataLemur, the problem statements have sample data and expected results.

Similar to DataLemur, the platform is easy to use, has a fast response time, and the solutions tab has some good alternative community solutions -- but an added bonus is that Analyst Builder has a video explanation, too!

The PostgreSQL version that Analyst Builder uses is 16.1, two versions ahead of DataLemur.

Correct solutions have a nice animation when you submit them üòÑ

For the most part, the recommended solutions are good.

### Cons ‚ùå

The "hard" problems are _waaay_ easier than the DataLemur ones; they're more like "medium" DataLemur ones.

Hopefully the "very hard" problems are actually hard, but I can't say for sure.

These questions are good for someone who's just starting out with SQL, but not for someone who's been working with SQL for a while.

## DataExpert.io

> [!NOTE]
>
> The problems are available at:
>
> - https://dataexpert.io/questions
>
> The platform uses Trino only.
>
> The platform is still a WIP, so I'll save the pros and cons for later.
